= Cover

Generate code coverage statistics for your Rails project and integrate it with your
Continuous Integration environment.  This plugin generates some rake tasks to generate 
coverage for your tests and will raise an exception if the coverage drops below an 
acceptable level.

== Installation

Make sure you have the latest version of Rcov installed:

    $ sudo gem install relevance-rcov --source=http://gems.github.com

Then install the plugin from Github:

    $ script/plugin install git://github.com/vigetlabs/cover.git

Once the plugin is installed, you'll need to freeze the default Rake task into your
project:

    $ rake cover:freeze

== Example

Out of the box, the plugin defines the following Rake tasks:

    rake cover:clobber_coverage  # Remove rcov products for coverage
    rake cover:coverage          # Analyze code coverage with tests for coverage
    rake cover:ensure            # Ensure code coverage at or above configured threshold

To use, simply run `rake cover:ensure` to generate code coverage statistics. This will raise
an exception and return a non-zero status (for use with a CI server).  By default, this plugin
is set up to quickly integrate with CruiseControl.rb with the `cruise` task:

    rake cruise # Run the cover:ensure task in the CruiseControl environment
    
== Configuration

By default, the plugin strives for 95% code coverage. If you want to tune this up or down in
your environment, configure the default Rake task:

    # lib/tasks/cover.rake
    Cover::Task.new do |t|
      t.threshold = 80
    end

Additionally, the Rake task has a dependency on the `db:migrate:reset` task.  You can 
configure this through the task definition:

    Cover::Task.new('db:migrate:reset', 'db:seed', 'other:task:here')

See the default Rake task for a more detailed example.
